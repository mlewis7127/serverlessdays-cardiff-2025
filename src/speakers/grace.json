            "abstract" : "Often Containers get left out the conversation as the move to serverless takes over, but they shouldn’t be! Azure Container Apps allows you to build event driven micro service architectures that are serverless while keeping infrastructure overhead to a minimum. Whether adopting a serverless first strategy or looking to move away from hosting simple work loads in sprawling Kubernetes Clusters, here’s an answer to how to have the best of both worlds. Let’s dive in the benefits of keeping Containers in the picture without compromising on the benefits of a serverless approach."
