            "title": "Adventures in cost control: tales from the trenches​",
            "abstract" : "There are lots of sessions that talk about the theory of cost management and tooling available on AWS, but far less look at the real world challenges of using those, as well as the rough edges they have. In this session Matt will cover some of the hard lessons learned from working with AWS over the last 14 years, with real-world examples of cost management done well and… not so well! The presentation is aimed at both those new to AWS and to veterans of the platform, and include practical advice and technical guidance on how to improve your cost management on AWS."
