# Tickets

We aim to keep ServerlessDays events accessible. A big part of that is making them financially accessible. The majority of ServerlessDays costs are covered by sponsors, which enables us to offer afforable tickets. 

In addition to afforable tickets we run a scholarship program for under represented minorities in tech. This has been done by joining up with local groups. For more details, please email us at [cardiff@serverlessdays.io](mailto:cardiff@serverlessdays.io)

If you are a member of the press or a tech analyst you can apply for tickets via emailing us at [cardiff@serverlessdays.io](mailto:cardiff@serverlessdays.io)
